# Spandrel — Public API

> **Status:** Draft, 2026-05-03. Will be normative as of 0.4.10.

This document lists the npm package's stable public surface. Imports listed here follow semver: breaking changes only on a major version bump. Anything *not* listed here is internal — it may move, rename, or change shape on a minor version.

The goal is portability: a TypeScript or JavaScript host should be able to import Spandrel into its own project, build against the documented surface, and trust that minor upgrades won't silently break.

---

## Top-level imports — `import { … } from "spandrel"`

Stable. Use these by default.

### Compiler

`DESIGN.md` companion files can carry optional `schema:` (JSON Schema, Draft 2020-12) and `graph:` (Spandrel link-semantics extensions) frontmatter keys; the compiler validates every member of the surrounding collection at build time and surfaces violations as advisory `ValidationWarning`s. See `specs/2026-05-10-collection-schemas.md` for the vocabulary; see `docs/content-model/design-md.md` for the user-facing summary. Validation is opt-in per collection and never blocks compilation.

```ts
import {
  compile,
  recompileNode,
  addGitMetadata,
  getHistory,
  buildManifest,
  nodeFrontmatterSchema,
} from "spandrel";

import type {
  SpandrelNode,
  SpandrelEdge,
  SpandrelGraph,
  ValidationWarning,
  HistoryEntry,
  LinkTypeInfo,
  BuildManifest,
  BuildManifestOptions,
  NodeFrontmatterSchema,
} from "spandrel";
```

The static JSON Schema file is also published at the package root:

```ts
import schema from "spandrel/schema.json" with { type: "json" };
```

### Storage

```ts
import { InMemoryGraphStore } from "spandrel";

import type { GraphStore, EdgeFilter } from "spandrel";
```

### Access policy

```ts
import {
  AccessPolicy,
  accessLevelAtLeast,
  loadAccessConfig,
} from "spandrel";

import type {
  Actor,
  AccessLevel,
  AccessConfig,
  Policy,
  RoleConfig,
  DenyRule,
  ShapedNode,
  ShapedEdge,
} from "spandrel";
```

### REST wire surface

```ts
import {
  createRestRouter,
  createNodeAdapter,
  actorFromRequest,
  shapeNodeAsJson,
  jsonResponse,
  textResponse,
  errorResponse,
  readJsonBody,
} from "spandrel";

import type {
  NodeJson,
  NodeReference,
  NodeJsonLinks,
  RestContext,
  RestHandler,
  ParsedUrl,
  WebRouter,
  NodeRouter,
} from "spandrel";
```

> **0.4.10 (shipped):** `createRestRouter` returns a Web-standard handler — `(req: Request) => Promise<Response | null>`. `null` means "no route matched, fall through." Hosts on Next.js, Hono, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Functions consume this directly. The reference Node CLI uses `createNodeAdapter(router)` to wrap it for `node:http`'s `(req, res) => Promise<boolean>` shape.

### MCP wire surface

```ts
import {
  createMcpServer,
  startMcpServer,
  registerReadOnlyTools,
  registerWriteTools,
  buildInstructions,
  runKeywordSearch,
} from "spandrel";

import type {
  McpServerOptions,
  RegisterReadOnlyToolsOptions,
} from "spandrel";
```

**MCP write tools** (registered when `rootDir` is supplied):

- **`create_thing`** — create a new node with frontmatter and optional links.
- **`update_thing`** — update fields on an existing node (partial update; unspecified fields are preserved).
- **`delete_thing`** — delete a node and its entire subtree. Refuses by default when inbound declared-link referrers exist; pass `cascade: "remove-link"` to remove dead link entries from every referrer's frontmatter before deleting. Returns `danglingMentions` listing inline prose mentions that were not auto-rewritten.
- **`move_thing`** — rename or move a node to a new path, cascading frontmatter rewrites across all declared-link referrers. Returns `danglingMentions` listing inline prose mentions that were not auto-rewritten.

### Markdown serialization

```ts
import { renderNodeAsMarkdown } from "spandrel";
```

Round-trips a `SpandrelNode` back to its on-disk source form (YAML frontmatter + body). Used by `spandrel dev`'s `.md` route and `spandrel publish`'s per-node siblings; available to any consumer that needs to emit a node as text.

---

## Sub-path imports — `import { … } from "spandrel/<path>"`

These exist because some helpers are too granular for the top-level surface but still belong in the public API. Sub-path imports listed here follow the same semver discipline as top-level.

```ts
// Pure helpers shared between MCP and REST. Stable.
import {
  resolveSearch,
  resolveGraph,
  MAX_GRAPH_DEPTH,
  resolveReferences,
  paginate,
  decorateLinkType,
} from "spandrel/graph-ops.js";

// Hyperlink construction for HAL-style _links blocks. Stable.
import { nodeHref } from "spandrel/rest/shape.js";
```

> **0.4.10 change:** `runConformanceTests` and `runAccessPolicyConformance` are removed from the top-level barrel (they were dragging vitest into consumer runtimes). Import them from `spandrel/storage/conformance.js` and `spandrel/access/conformance.js` respectively in your test files.

### Web viewer

The viewer source ships in `src/web/` and powers `spandrel publish`'s static SPA bundle. **The viewer's mount API is internal as of 0.7.0** — `mountViewer`, `createStaticDataSource`, `createRestDataSource`, `ViewerOptions`, `ViewerHandle`, `ViewerDataSource`, and the `spandrel/web/styles.css` re-export were public in 0.5.0 / 0.6.0 and are now removed from the package's exports map. Hosts that want to embed a graph viewer should run `spandrel publish` and serve (or iframe) the static bundle, or build their own viewer against the REST contract.

`renderNodeAsMarkdown` is unchanged and still exported from the top-level (see "Markdown serialization" above).

---

## CLI subcommands

The `spandrel` binary's subcommand surface is part of the stable public API — names, positional shape, and documented flags follow the same semver discipline as the library imports. Full reference lives in [`docs/architecture/cli`](./docs/architecture/cli.md); this section calls out the contract for each subcommand.

- **`spandrel init [target-dir]`** — scaffold a new knowledge repo. Prompts for `name` and `description`, or pass `--name` / `--description` non-interactively.
- **`spandrel init-mcp [root-dir]`** — emit MCP client config JSON.
- **`spandrel compile [root-dir] [--manifest [path]]`** — compile and validate; print nodes and every warning. `--manifest` writes a JSON build manifest (default path `spandrel-manifest.json`).
- **`spandrel dev [root-dir]`** — compile, watch, serve REST + viewer + per-node `.md` / `.json` routes on `PORT` (default `4000`).
- **`spandrel mcp [root-dir]`** — compile, watch, serve the MCP server over stdio.
- **`spandrel publish [root-dir] [--out <dir>] [--base <href>] [--static] [--site-url <url>] [--noindex] [--no-strip-private]`** — emit a static bundle for hosting.
- **`spandrel mv <from> <to> [root-dir] [--dry-run] [--yes]`** — rename or move a node, cascading frontmatter-link rewrites across every referrer. Previews to stderr; requires `--yes` to mutate.
- **`spandrel rm <path> [root-dir] [--cascade] [--dry-run] [--yes]`** — delete a node. Refuses by default when inbound declared-link referrers exist; `--cascade` strips dead link entries first. Previews to stderr; requires `--yes` to mutate.
- **`spandrel audit [root-dir] [--kinds <list>] [--format human|json] [--node <path>] [--severity all|advisory|warning] [--priority] [--semantic] [--semantic-model <name>] [--similarity-threshold <0..1>] [--max-candidates-per-node <int>]`** — query the advisory audit findings produced by the audit pass. Exits 0 in all normal cases (audit is advisory, never blocks). `--priority` groups findings by node and prints a ranked queue (heavy-fan-in, stale, weak-described nodes float to the top); score = `findingCount + 1.5·inDegree + 0.005·ageDays`. With `--format json`, `--priority` emits an array of `QueueItem` records: `{ path, score, scoreBreakdown: { findingCount, inDegree, ageDays }, warnings: ValidationWarning[] }` sorted by `score` descending, alphabetical tiebreak. `--node` and `--kinds` filter *before* ranking. As of WS-C3, `--kinds` also accepts the collection-schema validator codes (`missing_required_field`, `field_enum_violation`, `schema_violation`, `missing_required_link`, `disallowed_link_type`, `link_target_mismatch`, `missing_required_subcollection`, `naming_violation`, `invalid_graph_schema`). As of Phase E1, `--semantic` runs the missing-link detector against the cache populated by `spandrel embed` (errors with exit 1 if the cache is missing or stale, pointing at `spandrel embed`). `--semantic` adds the `missing_link` warning type to `--kinds`. `--semantic-model` auto-detects from the store (errors with a "pass --semantic-model" hint only when the store contains multiple models); `--similarity-threshold` defaults to `0.75`; `--max-candidates-per-node` defaults to `5`.

- **`spandrel embed [root-dir] [--provider local|openai|ollama] [--model <name>] [--yes]`** — populate the per-graph embedding cache at `<root-dir>/_audit/embeddings.db` (gitignored by default). Pre-condition for `spandrel audit --semantic`. Idempotent: only nodes whose `(path, sha256(name+description+body), model)` triple isn't already cached are re-embedded. Companion-file nodes (`kind: "document"`) are skipped. **Default provider is `local`** — a JS-native ONNX runtime via `fastembed` that requires zero setup. Downloads a ~25MB model file (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384 dim) to `~/.cache/spandrel/embeddings/` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/spandrel/embeddings/`) on first use and caches it for subsequent runs. OpenAI provider (`--provider openai`) uses `text-embedding-3-small` and reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the env. Ollama provider (`--provider ollama`) uses `nomic-embed-text` against `http://localhost:11434` (overridable via `OLLAMA_HOST`). With OpenAI and an estimated cost ≥ $0.10, prompts `[Y/n]` before making API calls; `--yes` skips. Local and Ollama are free → no prompt. Exit codes: 0 success, 1 operational failure (compile error, provider error, etc.), 2 user aborted the cost prompt.

`spandrel --version` (or `-v` / `version`) prints the installed package version.

## What's internal

Anything not listed above is internal. In particular:

- Anything under `spandrel/compiler/` other than the top-level `compile` re-export — internal compiler structure may change.
- Anything under `spandrel/storage/` other than `InMemoryGraphStore` and the `GraphStore` / `EdgeFilter` types — alternative reference implementations may come and go.
- Anything under `spandrel/server/` other than the top-level MCP exports — protocol-layer wiring is implementation detail.
- Anything under `spandrel/rest/` other than `nodeHref` (sub-path) and the top-level `createRestRouter` / `actorFromRequest` / `shapeNodeAsJson` exports.
- Anything under `spandrel/access/` other than the top-level access exports.
- Conformance test runners — must be imported from explicit `spandrel/storage/conformance.js` and `spandrel/access/conformance.js` paths in test files only.

If you need a helper that isn't on this list, file an issue describing the use case rather than depending on an internal path. The right answer is usually to promote the helper to the public surface.

## Semver discipline

- **Patch (`0.4.x` → `0.4.x+1`)** — bug fixes, additive doc changes, runtime hygiene. No surface change. Safe to take automatically.
- **Minor (`0.4.x` → `0.5.0`)** — new public API entries; backwards-compatible behavior changes; deprecation warnings. Existing public imports still work; some internal-but-discovered paths may move.
- **Major (`0.x` → `0.y`, eventually `1.0`)** — public surface changes. Breaking removals or renames on the listed surface; deprecated forms removed.

While Spandrel is on `0.x`, the surface is committed but the version itself is pre-1.0. Treat each minor as a coordinated upgrade window: read the changelog, run conformance tests, ship.

## Versioning history

- **0.3.x** — GraphQL-based serving. Top-level exports included `createSchema`, `SchemaContext`, and free-function access helpers.
- **0.4.0** — GraphQL removed from the spec; `AccessPolicy` class introduced; REST elevated to a peer of MCP. Top-level access free functions (`canAccess`, `canWrite`, `filterNodeFields`) moved to `AccessPolicy` methods.
- **0.4.10** — Conformance re-exports removed from the top-level barrel. REST router switches to Web-standard primitives (`createNodeAdapter` provided for `node:http` consumers). JSON Schema export for node frontmatter (`nodeFrontmatterSchema` + `schema.json` at package root). Build manifest from `spandrel compile --manifest`. `_*` reserved-prefix contract formalized in `/content-model`.
- **0.5.0** — Compiler resolves companion files as `kind: document, navigable: false` nodes. Embeddable viewer at `spandrel/web` with `mountViewer()`, injected data sources, theme-root locality, and CSS isolation. *(`spandrel/web` mount API removed in 0.7.0.)*
- **0.6.0** — Dropped deprecated lowercase companion-file forms (`design.md` → `DESIGN.md`, etc.). The `companion_file_lowercase` warning from 0.5.0 is now a compile error. Cascade-layer wrap on viewer styles; stable `spandrel/web/styles.css` re-export. *(`spandrel/web/styles.css` export removed in 0.7.0.)*
- **0.7.0** — Removed `spandrel/web` mount API and the `spandrel/web/styles.css` export. The viewer source remains in-tree to power `spandrel publish` only. Hosts that need an embed serve the static bundle or build their own UI against the REST/MCP contract. Top-level exports (compiler, storage, access policy, REST router, MCP server, `renderNodeAsMarkdown`) are unchanged.
- **0.8.0** — Graph mutations primitive. New `move_thing` MCP tool and `POST /node/{path}/move` REST endpoint. New `spandrel mv` and `spandrel rm` CLI subcommands. **Potentially breaking:** `delete_thing` MCP tool and `DELETE /node/{path}` REST endpoint now refuse by default when inbound declared-link referrers exist; pass `cascade: "remove-link"` (MCP) or `?cascade=remove-link` (REST) to opt into the old behavior. Move and delete cascade frontmatter-link rewrites across every referrer; inline prose mentions are surfaced as `danglingMentions` rather than auto-rewritten. Top-level imports unchanged.
- **0.9.0** — Link-type registry recast as system config. New `_links/config.yaml` (sibling of `_access/config.yaml`) replaces `/linkTypes/{stem}.md` Things-collection scaffolding. **Breaking:** `ShapedEdge.linkTypeDescription` removed from REST and MCP wire surfaces — agents see only `{from, to, type, linkType?, description?}` on every edge. MCP server instructions no longer render the link-type vocabulary block. The `enforce: [list]` semantic is dropped (replaced by boolean `enforce: true | false`). `LinkTypeInfo` shape changed from `{name, description, path}` to `{stem, description?}`. Schema.org type-aware JSON-LD projection removed (the per-link-type `schemaOrg:` frontmatter is no longer read; JSON-LD now emits `schema:mentions` for every edge). New: opt-in `min_uses: N` reuse-discipline governance, emitting `underused_link_type` warnings; `unknown_link_type` warning code (replaces `undeclared_link_type`). The registry is an authoring artifact, not an agent artifact — type-level prose lives in YAML for authors and authoring tools, not pushed into agent context.

## Reporting

If you're consuming Spandrel from another project and find yourself reaching for an internal path because the public surface doesn't cover your use case, file an issue at [github.com/trevorfox/spandrel/issues](https://github.com/trevorfox/spandrel/issues). The fix is to expand the public surface, not for you to depend on internals.
